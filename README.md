# Real Time Bus Tracker

## Description: 
This repository contains the code for a map animation web page. The code contains a marker that moves through the coordinates for all bus stops between the MIT campus and the Harvard campus when the user presses the "Move Bus" button upon page load.  

## How to Run:
Clone the full repository to reside in a single registry. Replace the MapBox access token with your own in the mapanimation.js file. 

## Roadmap of Future Improvements: 
The functionality of the mapanimation.js code has many improvement and repurposing opportunities. One improvement is to modify the code to have the map marker move to and from the two locations. This would be achieved by making the marker “turn around” after it reaches the MIT campus latitude and longitude coordinates. Additionally, the code can be repurposed to pull live data using API URLs provided by transportation departments. This data would replace the BusStops array data with the live data.
